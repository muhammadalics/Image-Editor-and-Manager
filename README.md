# Image Editor and Manager

The Image Editor and Manager aims to deliver fundamental image processing tools using graphical user interface. OpenCV and Numpy was used to implement the image processing operations while graphical user interface was created using PyQt5. Below are the demonstration gifs to show how to use the program. Result images are also included.

The image editor can do the following:

### Pyramid blending
Pyramid blending as described in A Multiresolution Spline With Application to Image Mosaics by Burt and Adelson was implemented.

### Cartoonification
The toonification algorithm as described in Toonify: Cartoon Photo Effect Application by Dade was implemented.

Negative
### Noise
Currently three different types of noises can be added to the images.
