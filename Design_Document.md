# Design Document

This file briefly describes the design of the project:

The user interface xml files were created using Qt Designer and are located in the folder named 'UI Files'. The ui files were compiled into python code and are present in the main project folder.

The image files for icons are located inside 'Resources' folder.

image_editor.py implements the code for all image processing functions used in the app.

main.py implements the graphical user interface and calls appropriate functions from image_editor.py.
